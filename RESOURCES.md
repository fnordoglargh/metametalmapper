### Graphexp

[Graphexp](https://github.com/bricaud/graphexp) 
is a lightweight web interface graph explorer with D3.js to explore and
display a graph stored in a Gremlin graph database.

### graph-tool

### Observations

graph-tool and Cytoscape both understand GML and GraphML.

## Examples

  * [Geocoding Paradise Papers Addresses In Neo4j](https://www.lyonwj.com/2017/11/28/geocoding-paradise-papers-neo4j-spatial-visualization/):
    Explores how to build spatial data visualizations using address data from
    the Paradise Papers leak of offshore corporations and the people 
    connected to them.
  * [Analyzing the Graph of Thrones](https://www.lyonwj.com/2016/06/26/graph-of-thrones-neo4j-social-network-analysis/):
    Nice analysis of the relationships of GoT characters with _Neo4j_.

## Comparison of Technologies

### Cypher vs Gremlin:

> For general querying, Cypher is enough and is probably faster. The advantage 
> of Gremlin over Cypher is when you get into high   level traversing. In 
> Gremlin, you can better define the exact traversal pattern (or your own 
> algorithms) whereas in Cypher the engine tries to find the best traversing 
> solution itself.
